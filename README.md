## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates how **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** can be used to automatically predict the most likely location of an image based on recognizable landmarks. The pipeline processes **user-supplied images** and outputs the **top-k most relevant landmarks** (from 50 possible landmarks across the world). By building this project, I explored the challenges of piecing together multiple models into a real-world pipeline, the tradeoffs between training **CNN from scratch** vs. **Transfer Learning**, and building an end-to-end app powered by deep learning.

## üéØ Motivation
Photo-sharing and storage platforms often rely on **location metadata** for features like automatic tagging, smart album organization, and location-based search. However, many images lack metadata (e.g., GPS disabled, privacy concerns, stripped EXIF data). This project addresses that gap by using **CNNs for landmark recognition** directly from image content.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
The project follows three main stages:
1. **CNN from Scratch** ‚Äì Implemented a CNN and trained it on landmark images.  
2. **Transfer Learning** ‚Äì Used pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG) for higher accuracy and faster convergence.  
3. **App Development** ‚Äì Built an application that accepts images as input and outputs the top probable landmarks.
